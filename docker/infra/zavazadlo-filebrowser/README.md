The config file is automatically generated by the docker container and you don't actually need to put it anywhere. It's here just for reference.

To disable authentication (because you are running a reverse proxy with auth), you can set `FB_NOAUTH=noauth` environment variable. But you have to do this before the first execution! If you don't, you have to delete the database and restart for this to take effect.
(It is also possible to do it through the config file, but I'm not quite sure what the right key/value are)

For Authelia, use the following `access_control` rules to make the file sharing work, 
but make everyone relevant login using 2FA:

```
rules:
    - domain:
        - "files.unsigned-short.com"
      resources:
        - "^/api/public/dl/*"
        - "/share/*"
        - "/static/js/*"
        - "/static/css/*"
        - "/static/img/*"
        - "/static/themes/*"
        - "/static/fonts/*"
        - "/static/assets/*"
      policy: bypass

   # Don't forget to set correct group if owners do not exist.
    - domain: 'files.unsigned-short.com'
      subject:
        - 'group:owners'
      policy: 'two_factor'

   # Use this if your default policy is one_factor.
    - domain: 'files.unsigned-short.com'
      policy: 'deny'
```
