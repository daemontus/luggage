## Power spec

#### Switch/PoE

[TP-LINK](https://www.tp-link.com/uk/business-networking/poe-switch/tl-sg1005lp/)

53.5V, 0.81A ~ 43W, up to 40W on PoE

Devices:
	- Switch itself (4.12W).
	- 2x Wifi access point (up to 10W each).
		* [TP-LINK](https://www.tp-link.com/us/business-networking/omada-sdn-access-point/eap615-wall/)
		* Can passthrough up to 13W PoE, but we don't use it right now.

Overall should be 24W/43W.

#### Pico PSU

[AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32816006065.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.21.47c41802PKFL67#nav-review)

12V input. Currently an old adapter from Synology: 12V, 4.16A ~ 50W.

PSU max load (see spec sheet):
	- 20-30W on 5V
	- 60-96W on 12V

Devices:
	- NanoPi RS5 (<10W peak over 5V, 4-6W typical).
		* [Wiki](https://wiki.friendlyelec.com/wiki/index.php/NanoPi_R5S).
		* Needs a very sketchy custom USB-C 5V cable.
	- 2x 3.5" HDD (5V, 0.7A, 3.5W; 12V, 0.55A 6.6W).
		* Alternatively, a 2.5" drive, (5V, 1.1A, 5.5W, but some sources show less).

Overall, should be ~17-20W/20W on 5V and ~14W/60W on 12V. Together, less than 40W/50W w.r.t. the AC/DC adapter.

## Adding SATA/USB drives

If you want to use a SATA/USB disk, you probably need to add support for `ext4`, such as outlined [here](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/storage/usb-drives). Also, [this](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/linux-format-disk) and [this](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Parted) is useful to read about how to partition the drive.

Afterwards, you can setup a mount point in the admin `System -> Mount Points -> Add -> Save and apply`. In this case, we are mounting it to `/mnt/hdd`.

Also, the OpenWRT page has a ton of info about how to spin down a drive to save power. Just note that spindown is not supported by default, you have to install it.

#### Add a new user just for sharing

Ideally, create a new user:

```
opkg install shadow-useradd
useradd --system sharing
id -u sharing
```

#### Create NFS share

If you then want to setup an NFS share, read about it [here](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/services/nas/nfs_configuration). Just make sure to properly set an IP/mask for the share so that it is only accessible from the local network (`192.168.2.0/24`).

Then, in `/etc/exports`, set up the share:
```
/mnt/hdd        192.168.2.0/24(rw,insecure,async,no_subtree_check,all_squash,anonuid=999,anongid=0)
```

Here, `anonuid` and `anongid` are set to match the ID and group ID of the new `sharing` user. Hence everything read/written on this share over the network should belong to `sharing`.

Finally, use `service nfsd reload` to restart the NFS service.

Afterwards, you can mount this share (on linux) by running as `root`:

```
mkdir /mnt/hdd
mount -t nfs kokoska:/mnt/hdd /mnt/hdd
```

However, for some reason this will not be always write-able/accessible on macOS. Hence you probably also want to configure SMB.

#### Create SMB share

You can mostly follow [this guide](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/services/nas/samba_configuration). At some point, you'll probably need to use `samba4` instad of `samba`. Also, the note about `security = user` in "share level access" section is outdated.

This is what `/etc/config/samba4` should look like in the end:

```
config samba
        option workgroup 'WORKGROUP'
        option charset 'UTF-8'
        option name 'Kokoska'
        option description 'Kokoska'
        option homes '1'

config 'sambashare'
        option 'name' 'HDD'
        option 'path' '/mnt/hdd'
        option read_only 'no'
        option guest_ok 'yes'
```

Furthermore, in `/etc/samba/smb.cont.template`, you should update/uncomment the following:

```
# This enables guest login for any user, as long as it is enabled for the share in question.
security = user
map to guest = Bad Password
# Remap group/owner of all file transfers to our sharing user.
force group = root
force user = sharing
```

Finally, restart samba service: `service samba4 restart`.
